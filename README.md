Pyglatin
========

"Pig Latin is a language where we move the first letter of a word to the end while also adding a vowel sound
If the original word starts with a vowel, you append the suffix 'ay' to the end of the word.
Example: abracadabra -> abracadabraay
If the original word starts with a consonant, you move the first letter of the word to the end and then append the suffix 'ay'.
Example: python -> ythonpay"
First of all It's my studying project in Codecademy.com, I take all of the upper description from codecademy.
